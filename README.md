## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

Check your installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Quick Start

### The Easiest Way (In VS Code)

**You're already here! Just use VS Code:**

1. **Look for "NPM SCRIPTS"** in the Explorer sidebar (bottom left)
2. **Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è** next to "start"
3. **Wait** for "Compiled successfully!" (~20 seconds)
4. **Ctrl+Click** the localhost:3000 link in the terminal
5. **Done!** üéâ

**Alternative:** Press `` Ctrl + ` `` ‚Üí Type `npm start` ‚Üí Press Enter

### First Time Setup

Only need to do this once:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all dependencies. After this, just use `npm start` every time.

### Manual Setup (If Needed)

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs:
- react & react-dom
- react-scripts (Create React App build tools)
- firebase (v10.7.1+)
- lucide-react (icons)

#### Step 2: Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The app will open automatically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

The build is minified and optimized for best performance. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## Firebase Setup

The app is already configured with Firebase credentials. Your Firebase project includes:

### Authentication
- **Provider**: Email/Password authentication
- **Security**: Passwords must be at least 6 characters

### Realtime Database
- **Structure**:
  ```
  users/
    {userId}/
      email: string
      displayName: string
      trackedShows: [showId1, showId2, ...]
      watchedEpisodes: {
        "showId-season-episode": true,
        ...
      }
      preferences: {
        notifications: boolean,
        autoMarkWatched: boolean,
        defaultService: string
      }
      createdAt: timestamp
  ```

- **Security Rules**: Already configured to allow users to read/write only their own data

### Offline Support
The app automatically falls back to localStorage when:
- Firebase is unreachable
- User is offline
- Firebase quota is exceeded

Data syncs to Firebase when connectivity is restored.

## TVMaze API Integration

The app uses the free TVMaze API for show data:
- **No API key required**
- **Endpoints used**:
  - `/schedule?country=US` - Today's airing shows
  - `/shows/{id}?embed[]=episodes&embed[]=nextepisode` - Show details
  - `/search/shows?q={query}` - Search shows
  - `/singlesearch/shows?q={name}` - Find specific show

**Rate Limits**: The API has no strict rate limits but please be respectful with requests.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Build the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `build` folder:
   - Drag and drop to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
   - Or use Netlify CLI:
     ```bash
     npm i -g netlify-cli
     netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
     ```

### Deploy to Firebase Hosting

1. Install Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login and initialize:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init hosting
   ```

3. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use

If you see "Port 3000 is already in use":

**Windows**:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**Mac/Linux**:
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

Or set a different port:
```bash
set PORT=3001 && npm start   # Windows
PORT=3001 npm start          # Mac/Linux
```

### Firebase Connection Issues

If Firebase fails to connect:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Firebase credentials in `src/firebase.js`
- Check Firebase console for project status
- The app will fallback to localStorage automatically

### TVMaze API Issues

If shows don't load:
- Check your internet connection
- TVMaze API may be temporarily down (rare)
- CORS errors: TVMaze allows CORS by default, but some browsers may block it
- Try searching for a specific show name

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

1. Clear node_modules and reinstall:
   ```bash
   rmdir /s node_modules  # Windows
   rm -rf node_modules    # Mac/Linux
   npm install
   ```

2. Clear npm cache:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

3. Check Node.js version (must be v14+):
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

### CSS Not Loading

If styles don't appear correctly:
- Ensure `src/App.css` is imported in `src/index.js`
- Try clearing browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check browser console for errors
